"""Locust load test for Motor Insurance Claim Intake & Triage (D6, A7).

Measures the SLI declared in docs/SLO.md: wall-clock time from POST /claims to the first poll that returns a terminal
status. Recorded as the custom metric `claim_full_lifecycle` (request_type E2E) and, per run, as a CSV row.

Design rules (each fixes a way a load test can quietly lie):
  * A run that does not finish within LOAD_POLL_TIMEOUT_S is RECORDED AS A FAILURE with its elapsed time. The earlier
    version returned silently, so the slowest runs, i.e. the SLO breaches, disappeared from the statistics.
  * A run that ends `failed` counts as a failure even though HTTP was 200.
  * Valid-claim latency is kept apart from malformed-claim traffic (LOAD_MALFORMED_PCT, default 0), because instant
    422s would drag percentiles down and change how many runs are really in flight.
  * Every user gets a unique client id and policy number, so neither the rate limiter (D7) nor the run cache is hit:
    this measures the agents, which is what the SLO is about. (Cache effect is measured by scripts/benchmark_cache.py.)

Env:
  LOAD_RUNS_CSV          append one row per finished run here (used by scripts/load_steps.py)
  LOAD_STOP_FILE         when this file exists, users finish their current run and submit no more (clean shutdown)
  LOAD_POLL_TIMEOUT_S    default 120
  LOAD_POLL_INTERVAL_S   default 0.5 (included in the SLI as polling granularity)
  LOAD_MALFORMED_PCT     default 0
  LOAD_DESCRIPTION_MIX   "plain" (default) | "mixed" (adds the section 4.1 delivery case and theft)
